Hi! This is the homepage of XU Tianyang, Sally.
My research interests are speech emotion recognition and natural language understanding.

B.Eng of Electronic & Information Engineering (2017-2021) Hong Kong Polytechnic University

In my free time, I enjoy jazz, funk and dreampop. I love travelling, reading (especially fiction novels) and watching movies. I'm a lifelong language learner, always fascinated by languages!
I could play some piano and guitar. My favorite sports is swimming. I have two cats :)

I was a previous member of the Light & Sound team of PolyU English Drama Club.

My biggest dreams are:
1. Go to the space;
2. Learn how to play jazz drums;
3. Be a linguist.

Feel free to contact me using this email:

Cheers!
